#### ESM standalone bundles ([#8983](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/pull/8983) by [@Monchi](https://github.com/Monchi), [@fisker](https://github.com/fisker))

Now standalone is also bundled as ESM. It works directly on browser.

```js
import prettier from "https://unpkg.com/prettier/esm/standalone.mjs";
import parserGraphql from "https://unpkg.com/prettier/esm/parser-graphql.mjs";

prettier.format("query {     }", {
  parser: "graphql",
  plugins: [parserGraphql],
});
```
